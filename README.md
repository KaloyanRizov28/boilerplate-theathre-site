This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Admin Authentication

The app uses Supabase for authentication and role-based access:

1. Users have an `is_admin` flag stored in their `auth.users` metadata.
2. Run `node scripts/seed-admin.js you@example.com` with the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` environment variable to promote an account.
3. Row level security on admin tables allows mutations only when the JWT includes `is_admin = true` (see `supabase/rls-policies.sql`).
4. The `/login` page uses Supabase `signInWithPassword` and admins can access `/admin` after authentication. Middleware enforces these rules and non-admins are redirected back to `/login`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
